My name is Kevin Downs and I'm a software engineer located on the bottom of Africa. All content on this blog is, and will always be my opinion only and does not reflect the opinions of anyone I may be affiliated with. You can get in touch with me using the flashy icons at the top of these pages - please do, I'm always up for a chat. This is my first blog post, ironically, about setting up a pipeline for developing your own personal blog using the same technologies I'll be using for this one. 

I plan on dedicating my blog to detailing tutorials and interesting findings related to technologies I use in my day-to-day life, or technologies and topics that interest me. In this way, this is more of a technical blog - hopefully it'll be of some use to people other than myself. In my every day life I'm a .NET developer working on the whole stack (technically). I've got some experience in Java as well, nothing professional though, but I'm more of a Microsoft man. However, this doesn't mean that I'm be entirely focussed on .NET - I'm a lover of all technologies including Vanilla Javascript, jQuery, Node.JS, front-end frameworks (that I'd love to get more experience with), etc. Ultimately, I'm here to learn and hopefully help other people along the way.

To get started, I wanted something simple for this blog. I've got some really cheap hosting (free in fact), all I pay for is a domain. Unfortunately, this a limitation of this is I've only got access to using PHP and MySQL. However, these are pretty overkill in this situation. All that's really needed is a static site.
